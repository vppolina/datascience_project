seconds renting vs buying vs time sharing someone owns house expect right use house free group people buy house together expect right use house proportional percentage ownership house fee based blockchain like renting house owners whereas rate limiting like timeshare among owners house owned multiple people individuals must decide wish timeshare house someone owns house uses one weekend per year might expect paid individuals take unused time mindset fee based system hand someone owns house speculating demand house increase future able sell stake owner owns house use becomes real estate speculator mindset rather collecting rent collect appreciation value share derived much time potentially grant owner owning house getting weekend per year lowest value share however half shareholders never use weekend value per timeshare rises weekends per year inactive users instead opt rent unused time falls back weekend per year unused timeshares sold people would use value timeshare would fall unless rent collected greater fall share value timeshare owners making economic miscalculation using rationale assume system based fees either expensive users less profitable collective owners individual small owner may profit renting small time slice expense timeshare owners effect cost falling timeshare value shared among owners whereas profits centralized single owner decided rent share conclude blockchain best served using usage fees usage fee charged alternative rate limiting equivalent buying enough timeshares committing hold long enough gain right use stated another way
